                        The fact that <em>Timely Comics</em> (the 1930's and 40's predecessor to <strong>Marvel Comics</strong>) characters coexisted in the same world was first established in <em>Marvel Mystery Comics</em> where <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/namor/in-comics">Namor</a> was mentioned in <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/human-torch-johnny-storm/in-comics">Human Torch</a>'s story, and vice versa. Thought the concept of a <strong>shared universe</strong> was new unique to <strong>comics books</strong> in 1961, write/editor <strong>Stan Lee</strong>, together with several artists including <strong>Jack Kirby</strong> and <strong>Steve Ditko</strong>, created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stroies would show characters growth and change.

                        Headline characters in one title would make cameos or guest appearances in other books. Eventually, many of the leading heroes (<a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/ant-man-scott-lang/in-comics">Ant Man</a>, <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/wasp-janet-van-dyne/in-comics">Wasp</a>, <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/iron-man-tony-stark/in-comics">Iron Man</a>, <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/thor-thor-odinson/in-comics">Thor</a> and <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/hulk-bruce-banner/in-comics">Hulk</a>) assembled into a team known as the Avengers, which debuted in September 1963. This was not the first time that Marvel's characters had interacted with one another but it was the first time that the comic book publisher's characters seemed to share world. <strong>The Marvel Universe</strong> was also notable for setting its central titles in <em>New York City</em>.

                    <p>
                        <strong>The Marvel Universe</strong> is trongly based on the real world. Earth in the <strong>Marvel Universe</strong> has all the features of the real one: same countries, same personalities (politicians, movie stars, etc), same historical events (such as World War II), and so on; however, it also contains many other fictional elements: countries such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakanda">Wakanda</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latveria">Latveria</a> (very small nations) and organitzations like the espionage agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> and its enemies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(comics)">HYDRA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Idea_Mechanics">A.I.M</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most importanly, the <strong>Marvel Universe</strong> algo incorportates examples of almost all major science fiction and fantasy conecpts, with wirters adding more continuously. Aliens, gods, magic, cosmic powers and extremely advanced human-developed technology all exist prominently in the <strong>Marvel Universe</strong>. Thanks to these extra elements, Earth in the <strong>Marvel Universe</strong> is home to a large number of superheroes and supervillains, who have gained their powers by any of these means.

                <h2>Universes/Earths</h2>
                <p>
                    The action of most of the <strong>Marvel Comics</strong> titles place in a continuity known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-616">Earth-616</a>. This continuity exists in a multiverse alongside trillions of alternative continuities.
                </p>

                        In addition, multiple continuties ara visited in the comic book series What If, What The?! and Exiles. The concept of continuity is not the same as a <q>dimension</q> or a <q>universe</q>; for example, characters like <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/mephisto/in-comics">Mephisto</a> and <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/dormammu/in-comics">Dormammu</a> hail from parellel dimensions and <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/galactus/in-comics">Galactus</a> from the universe that existed before the <strong>Big Bang</strong> which began the current universe, but they all nevertheless belong to the <em>Earth-616</em> continuity.

            <h2>Avengers</h2>
            <h3>Foundation</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>The Avengers</strong> have been assembled by fate as a group of extraordinary champions with
                diverse abilities. As Earth's mightiest heroes, their purpose is to protect and safeguard the world from
                both domestic and extraterrestrial threats. Finding strength in union, they uphold their tradition to
                overcome menaces a single individual could not withstand. <strong>The Avengers</strong> usually count
                with official recognition and clearance as a peacekeeping initiative that fights for liberty and
                justice, being funded chiefly by <em>Tony Stark</em> and inspired by <em>Steve Rogers</em>.

                When <strong>Loki</strong>, the Asgardian God of Mischief, influenced the monstrous Hulk to destroy a
                railway line, the Hulk's friend, Rick Jones, and his Teen Brigade attempted to radio the Fantastic Four
                for help. However, Loki relayed the information to his brother instead, the God of Thunder Thor, in
                order to draw him into battle. Circumstantially, other super-heroes namely the Wasp, Ant-Man, and Iron
                Man also received the intercepted signal unbeknownst to <strong>Loki</strong> and arrived at the scene
                to reason with the <strong>Green Goliath</strong>. Not falling for the trick, Thor confronted
                <strong>Loki</strong> and exposed his scheme to the other heroes. Defeating <strong>Loki</strong>
                together, the group agreed they worked well together and should be formalized as a team. <strong>The
                    Wasp</strong> suggested the name <q>Avengers</q>, and Earth's Mightiest Heroes were born. Rick Jones
                and the Teen Brigade became regular allies and informants to the <strong>Avengers</strong>, being in
                close and constant contact during their initial missions.

                The newly formed team assembled at the Manhattan mansion of industrialist Tony Stark (in secrecy, their
                fellow member <strong>Iron Man</strong>). Stark donated the mansion to the <strong>Avengers</strong> for
                their exclusive use and set up a foundation to cover the operation expenses of the nonprofit team, the
                Maria Stark Foundation named after his late mother. The team also put down a charter to govern their
                activities. Additionally, the Stark family's trusted butler, Edwin Jarvis, was kept on as the principal
                regular domestic employee at what became known as the <em>Avengers Mansion</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <em>Avengers Mansion</em>, the Avengers faced their next adversity, the alien shapeshifting
                invader from Limbo known as the Space Phantom, who impersonated <strong>the Avengers</strong> inciting
                them to fight each other. Upon his defeat, the <strong>Hulk</strong> realized his teammates mistrusted
                his uncontrollable nature and decided to abandon the Avengers. The group unsuccessfully tried to reach
                out the Hulk, who in turn had associated himself with Namor, the raging Sub-Mariner, to combat his
                former allies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following his fight against the Avengers, Namor unleashed a block of ice containing a figure under the
                North Sea, which was then found by the Avengers. Within it, laid the legendary hero Captain America in
                suspended animation, frozen in ice since just before the end of World War II. Needing to adjust to the
                world he awoke in, Captain America joined the mighty Avengers after helping them to defeat Vuk, an alien
                stranded on Earth, and Namor one more time. A born leader, the star-spangled myth was eventually given
                retroactive "founding member" status in place of the <strong>Hulk</strong>, and was seen as the heart
                and soul of the Avengers. With <strong>Captain America</strong> by their side, <strong>the
                    Avengers</strong> faced enemies like the <strong>Lava Men</strong>, the <strong>Mole Man</strong>,
                the <strong>Red Ghost</strong>,the aristocratic Count Nefaria and his Maggia and the Kallusians, as well
                as teamed up with the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> against the <strong>Hulk</strong> and the
                <strong>Mole Man</strong> again
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the Avengers' most powerful enemies were the Masters of Evil, a group of resentful villains
                assembled by <strong>Baron Heinrich Zemo</strong> as a reaction to the return of his long-lost
                adversary: <strong>Captain America</strong>. <strong>Black Knight</strong>, <strong>Melter</strong> and
                <strong>Radioactive Man</strong> completed the group, seeking revenge against the other Avengers.
                Shortly after, Enchantress and Executioner integrated the team, in a failed attempt to trick Thor into
                destroy his comrades. In their next attack, the Masters of Evil granted phenomenal powers to the
                industrialist Simon Williams, who infiltrated the Avengers as Wonder Man. Unexpectedly, Wonder Man
                turned on Zemo after gaining the Avengers' trust and was slain for his betrayal. Following other battles
                against the Masters of Evil, at one time under the machinations of the master of time Immortus, the
                Avengers witnessed the end of their foes when <strong>Zemo</strong> perished in a fatal rock-slide
                triggered by his own weaponry during a fight against <strong>Captain America</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In between battles with the Masters of Evil, the time traveler known as Kang the Conqueror also fought
                the Avengers, trying to take over the world with his advanced technology from the 30th century. Losing
                once, Kang used a <strong>Spider-Man</strong> android to fool the Avengers and gain the team's trust to
                betray them. Yet, his second plan failed thanks to the intervention of the real Spider-Man. Kang escaped
                back into the timestream and, in the years to come, would become one of the <strong>Avengers</strong>'
                most threatening enemies.

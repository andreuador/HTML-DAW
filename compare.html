            <p>
                In October 1939, what was then called <em>Timely Comics</em>, published the mythical<q>Marvel Comics
                    #1</q>. In it appeared <strong>Namor</strong>, the underwater man, a villain who terrorized the
                terrestrial population fed up with how badly they treated the sea. This son of an Atlantean princess and
                sailor, he changed sides shortly after to fight for humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
                For its part, National Comics, DC's grandfather, introduced Aquaman two years later, the son of a
                scientist who had the ability to breathe underwater and talk to minnows. Later his story would change to
                be the governor of the Atlantean kingdom and look even more like his little marvel neighbor.
            </p>

            <h3>Captain America (Marvel, 1941) vs Guardian (DC, 1942)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/captainvsguardian.jpg" alt="Captain America vs Guardian">
            </figure>
            <p>
                In 1941, with half of Europe in chaos, American needed someone to smack the Nazis to feel safe. <em>Jack
                    Kirby</em> and <em>Joe Simons</em> did well, but they were pissed off when they saw that their
                Captain America provided benefits to the brand that they did not notice in the first person.
            </p>
            <p>
                They took their things and settled into the competition, creating Guardian, a hero who, although he did
                not hace super powers, did have an impenetrable shield and fireproof values.
            </p>

            <h3>The Doomed Patrol (DC, June 1963) vs The X-Men (Marvel, September 1963)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/doomedvsxmen.jpg" alt="The Doomed Patrol vs The X-Men">
            </figure>
            <p>
                In '63 there was an explosion of heroic groups. DC introduced its <strong>Doom Patrol</strong> in June,
                a group of heroes with powers that no one wanted and who had been marginalized from society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three months later, <strong>Marvel</strong> released the <strong>X-Men</strong>, mutants who fought for
                humanity and to gain a place among people, scared by their powers, They say that <em>Stan Lee</em> had
                been preparing the idea for a long time after eavesdropping on a conversation in the DC offices about
                the group of disinherited from him.
            </p>

            <h3>Flash (DC, 1940) vs Quicksilver (Marvel, 1964)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/flashvsquick.jpg" alt="Flash vs Quicksilver">
            </figure>
            <p>
                The first superhero sprinter arrived in the 40s, Able to move with unthinkable speed, breaking various
                laws of physics along the way, different incarnations of <strong>Flash</strong> often gain powers from
                him due to accidents involving chemicals.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the big difference with <strong>Quicksilver</strong> since twenty-four years later they could
                not take it anymore and they took out their own speedy hero, with a mutant explanation in between. This
                son of <strong>Magneto</strong> seems to violate the same laws of physics and can unfold in two film
                versions at the same time.
            </p>

            <h3>Green Arrow (DC, 1941) vs Hawkeye (Marvel, 1964)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/arrowvshawkeye.jpg" alt="Arrow vs Hawkeye">
            </figure>
            <p>
                Robin Hood plus <strong>Batman</strong>, that's the idea. <strong>Green Arrow</strong>, who some
                romantics still know as the <strong>Green Arrow</strong>, appeared in the pages of <em>DC</em> in the
                1940s and quickly entered teh <strong>Justice League</strong> to distribute his technological creushes
                to enemies of all kinds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Marvel</strong>. again allowing a reasonable time to pass, presented its version of the
                characterin villain mode, and shortly after turning <em>Clint Burton</em> into one of the good guys and
                letting him swell the ranks of the <strong>Avengers</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Darkseid (DC, 1970) vs Thanos (Marvel, 1973)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/darkseidvsthanos.jpg" alt="Darkseid vs Thanos">
            </figure>
            <p>
                <strong>Darkseid</strong>, is the gigantic boss of Apokolips, has all kinds of powers and is obsessed
                with finding the formula of anti-life to send us all to the other neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thanos</strong>, is the crazed titan who travels through space seated on a throne, has divine
                powers and is obsessed with binding himself to death, literally.
            </p>

            <h3>Deathstroke (DC, 1983) vs Deadpool (Marvel, 1991)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/deathvsdeadpool.jpg" alt="Deathstroke vs Deadpool">
            </figure>
            <p>
                <em>Slade Wilson</em>, which is that the man from <strong>DC</strong> is called, is a bloodthirsty and
                efficient hitman. Genetically enhanced, his agility, strength, endurance and healing factor are better
                than those of any human being, as well as his ability to develop plans and his handling of any type of
                weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
                When <em>Rob Liefeld</em> created <strong>Deadpool</strong>, whom in Spain we know as <em>Masacre</em>,
                he was so crazy that he baptized his human personality as <strong>Wade Wilson</strong>. not a half turn.
